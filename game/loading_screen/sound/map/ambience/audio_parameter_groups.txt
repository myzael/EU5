##### TERRAIN Pulls data from audio tags, max_elements is how many different tags will be considered (in descending value), 
##### normalize take calculates fraction/percentage whereas non normalized calculates absolute value (likely what we want in Caesar)

terrain = {
    should_normalize=yes
    max_elements = 10
}

camera_state = {
    should_normalize=no
