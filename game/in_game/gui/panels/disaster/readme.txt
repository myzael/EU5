# If you want to create a disaster:

# 1. Check the documentation for situations as it is the same for disasters except for the possible blocks: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1niGUOytdJsIKI7baMI7giofWZ2Psqinj5TRlc6CC8ac/edit#heading=h.sa6s1ckj3cmo
# 2. Use a disaster that has similar building blocks as yours.
# 3. If you want to make a different layout than one of the other disasters, suggest it to Eric. If it is approved, you can then make it.
# 4. If you have any doubt ask your trusted UI programmer
